# Getting started with Hackathons
A quick guide for UTD Freshman and first-timers.

## What and why?
Hackathons are an awesome way to build ideas and learn technology. Additionally, they provide a great opportunity to network with engineers, recruiters and other programmers.
The best part? most of them are **FREE**.

Here's a short video:

## Where to find them?

1. MLH has a [huge list](https://mlh.io/seasons/na-2018/events) of student hackathons at colleges across the US that are FREE to attend. Most of them require an application to get in.

2. [Hackalist](http://www.hackalist.org/) let's you filter hackathons which provide travel-reimburesements, have prizes and allow high-schoolers. It also contains those hackathons that are not sponsored by MLH.

3. Misc:  
  * [ATT](https://devsummit.att.com/hackathon-invitational) organizes a few hackathons every year across the US. There's one    every year in Dallas too and it's open for students.

* Developer conferences like [API World](http://apiworld.co/) and [Developer Week](http://www.developerweek.com/) also organize weekend long hackathons during their conferences.

## HH Community 
[Hackathon Hackers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/hackathonhackers/) is a community of student hackers. It's a great place to share ideas, memes and connect with other hackers.

## What to build at these hackathons?
Anything. That crazy idea for App, you had a few weeks ago. Or that intelligent door knob you always wanted to create. How about a reddit-clone for your school? 

Just create. Get started even if you have never created an App, worked with Raspberry Pis or created a website. 

## How to get started 
No. You don't need to be a pro in Java to create an Android App. 

Don't let your past knowledge of things restrict you. Google is your friend. Find getting-started tutorials on Google or videos on YouTube. Follow them step by step until you have something working. Next step is to get an understanding of how that thing is working. This can be done by changing a few things here and there and observing what happens. Then move ahead.

The goal is to create a working prototype and to achieve this, you have learn and out things together in 24 hours.

## Final Note

Take baby steps. I spoke to a lot of my peers to get them involved into hackathons. One thing I noticed- they always wanted to finish a course in college or online and get experience
