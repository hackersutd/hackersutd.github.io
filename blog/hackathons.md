# Getting started with Hackathons
A quick guide for UTD Freshman and first-timers.

## What and why?
Hackathons are an awesome way to build ideas and learn technology. Additionally, they provide a great opportunity to network with engineers, recruiters and other programmers.
The best part? most of them are **FREE**.

Here's a short video:

## Where to find them?

1. MLH has a [huge list](https://mlh.io/seasons/na-2018/events) of student hackathons at colleges across the US that are FREE to attend. Most of them require an application to get in.

2. [Hackalist](http://www.hackalist.org/) let's you filter hackathons which provide travel-reimburesements, have prizes and allow high-schoolers. It also contains those hackathons that are not sponsored by MLH.

3. Misc:  
  * [ATT](https://devsummit.att.com/hackathon-invitational) organizes a few hackathons every year across the US. There's one    every year in Dallas too and it's open for students.

* Developer conferences like [API World](http://apiworld.co/) and [Developer Week](http://www.developerweek.com/) also organize weekend long hackathons during their conferences.

## HH Community 
[Hackathon Hackers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/hackathonhackers/) is a community of 60,000+ student hackers. It's a great place to share ideas, memes and connect with other hackers.

## What to build at these hackathons?
Anything. That crazy idea for App, you had a few weeks ago. Or that intelligent door knob you always wanted to create. How about a reddit-clone for your school? 

Just create. Get started even if you have never created an App, worked with Raspberry Pis or created a website. 

## How to get started 
Don't let your past knowledge of things restrict you. 

Google and YouTube are your friend.Find getting-started tutorials on Google or videos on YouTube. Follow them step by step until you have something working. Next step is to get an understanding of how that thing is working. This can be done by changing a few things here and there and then observing what happens. Once you are comfortable, move forward.

Example: [Create a Messenger bot in 15 mins](https://github.com/jw84/messenger-bot-tutorial)

   [Create your first Android App in 15 mins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAJeK283j0I)

The goal is to create a working prototype and to achieve this, you have learn and put things together in 24 hours.

**APIs** make the lifes of programmers easy. Example: Need your code to automatically send a text when something happens? [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/docs/quickstart/node/programmable-sms) has an API that let's you send a text message in just 14 lines of code. 

Similarly, Google Maps API can be used to integrate a real world map into your hack.

[Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs), [Docusign](https://secure.docusign.com/demo), [Facebook Graph](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/) and [Twitter](https://developer.twitter.com/) are some APIs commonly used by hackers since they are super easy to get started with.

## Final Note

Take baby steps. I spoke to a lot of my peers to get them involved into hackathons and one thing I noticed- they always wanted to wait and finish some course in college and get experience before going to hackathons. You don't need that. All or most of the learning can be done at hackathons.
