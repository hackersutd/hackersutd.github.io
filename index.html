      <h2>Hackers UTD is a group of students who are focused on participation of hackathons.</h2>
      <p>Hackathons are fun and exciting--they bring a group of engineers together and foster growth and collaboration.
        The hackathon encompasses both learning and creation; participants learn a lot about programming during the hack,
        while at the same time create a brand new product.The end result is not only the created product, but also result
        in camaraderie between the participants that lend to lifelong friendships.</p>
      <p>Hackers UTD will participate in local and national hackathons in the United States, as well as holding HackDFW.</p>

        <h2>What is a hackathon?</h2>
        <p>A hackathon is an event where people build technology. They consist of a pre-defined timeframe (i.e. 24 hours) focused in creating something new and innovative. </p>
        <p>It is a competition, but the focus is not on the competitive part in itself--the goal is to make some friends, to learn, and make something. They are very collaborative events where engineers (and business people) of all skill levels and ages go to participate.</p>

        <p>You get to meet prospective employers, and it looks great on your resume. You also get free food, (usually) free travel, and get connected with other talented programmers!</p>
