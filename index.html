        <h2>What is a hackathon?</h2>
        <p>A hackathon is an event where people build technology. They consist of a pre-defined timeframe (i.e. 24 hours) focused in creating something new and innovative. </p>
        <p>It is a competition, but the focus is not on the competitive part in itself--the goal is to make some friends, to learn, and make something. They are very collaborative events where engineers (and business people) of all skill levels and ages go to participate.</p>

        <h2>Why should I go?</h2>
        <p>You get to meet prospective employers, and it looks great on your resume. You also get free food, (usually) free travel, and get connected with other talented programmers!</p>
